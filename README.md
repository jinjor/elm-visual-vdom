[DEMO](https://jinjor.github.io/elm-visual-vdom/)



## What is this?

An experiment to show where in the View is acrually rendered by Model changes.
This is possible by [some modification](https://github.com/jinjor/elm-visual-vdom/commit/ea85f6bb61d392f6ed0b41904d1b924e4224663c#diff-7a0987b9f8268f26f0e697b48ece0270) to Elm 0.18 debugger (elm-lang/virtual-dom).



## Where to go from here

Maybe it is also possible to show if `lazy` functions are correctly working or not.
This would help people to optimize rendering performance.
